Introduction:
Hello! I'm Anas El Assri, a passionate and detail-oriented Front-End Web Developer based in Morocco.
I specialize in building responsive and user-friendly web interfaces that blend creativity with clean code.

Details:
With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React and Next.js,
I bring ideas to life through efficient and scalable code.
I have also worked with tools and libraries such as Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, Framer Motion, Redux, and Git.

Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve completed several internships and freelance projects,
building web applications for student management, e-commerce platforms, and dynamic UI components.
I'm experienced in working with APIs, ensuring performance, accessibility, and cross-browser compatibility.

I enjoy solving problems and creating digital experiences that are not only functional but also delightful to use.
Whether collaborating with a team or leading a project, I take pride in communication, time management, and continuous learning.

In my free time, I love coding side projects, playing volleyball, and cycling.
My mission is to contribute to innovative web solutions and grow with teams that value clean design,
quality code, and impactful user experience.
